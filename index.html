        <span class="heading1">Researchers Discover Brain Reorganizes after Hearing Loss</span>
        <span class="description1">Researchers exploring the ways in which our brains respond to hearing loss have found
            that the brain reorganizes, which may be related to a link between age-related hearing loss and dementia.
            According to a presentation at the 169th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) being held May
            18-22 in Pittsburgh, Pa, researchers from the University of Colorado suggest that the portion of the brain
            devoted to hearing can become reorganized—reassigned to other functions—even with early-stage hearing loss,
            and may play a role in cognitive decline.</span>
